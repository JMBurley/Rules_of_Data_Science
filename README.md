# Rules of Data Science

## Introduction
These rules of data science are intended as advice to make you a better data scientist or better understand data science if you work with data scientists. Some of them are facts (eg. "models are terrible at extrapolation") and some of them are heuristics (eg. "You will be better at data science if you think of it as decision science").  Each of these `rules` is something I have high certainty is important and will make a meaningful change to the quality of work you output.

In the interests of memorability each `rule` is listed as a pithy, single-sentence assertion.

Of course, single-sentence assertions are neither evidence nor a particularly good way for a reader to understand the underlying dynamics if the assertion does not immediately resonate with their own experience.  Therefore you can click each "Rule" to open an expanded section that briefly explains the reasoning behind it.  These sections are a balance between brevity and completeness that leans towards brevity at the expense of considering all edge cases or when the rule might not apply; I want to equip you with enough information to decide when & if you will make use of the rule.  Even I do not think these are cast iron rules that are true in all situations all of the time (although some of them are close to it!), be thoughtful and make use of them as best suits you.


## Why should you trust my opinions?
You probably shouldn’t trust anyone’s opinions purely from their background (there a (logical fallacy)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority] about that), but background certainly helps set a baseline expectation of reliability.

I’ve spent >15 years on science, strategy consulting, building models of physical processes, and data science.  My time in strategy consulting was when (“big data” became a thing)[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=big%20data] and I was the frontline consultant doing analysis and creating new methods in my firm.  I ran data science projects in the Foundry.ai studio building prototype AI systems with several Fortune 500 companies and spoke with people from CEOs, through division heads, to frontline staff to make AI projects with positive ROI within 12 months.  Currently, I am head of data science at a start-up with a few million in revenue.  

I also did well on the UK nationally televised TV quiz “University Challenge”, which sounds like it should be irrelevant, save that the weird brain trick of being good at quizzes is about collating information and synthesising patterns into best guesses,  which is basically what a “Rules of Data Science” is.
